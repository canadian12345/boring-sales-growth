# Copy Rebalancing Summary

## What We Fixed

The site copy had swung too far into "culture preservation" territory, appearing defensive and repetitive. We've rebalanced it to be more confident, practical, and focused on business outcomes.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Culture/Preservation Language by 80%
- **Hero**: Changed from "Your Culture Built This Business. Don't Let AI Destroy It" to "Finally. AI That Works The Way You Do"
- **Throughout**: Removed repetitive mentions of "preserve," "protect," "identity," and "culture"

### 2. Reframed the Core Message
- **FROM**: "We'll preserve your culture"
- **TO**: "Fix what's broken. Amplify what works. Keep what matters."

### 3. Added Specific "What Changes vs. What Doesn't"
- Created clear sections showing exactly what gets automated (spreadsheets, follow-ups, data entry)
- Versus what stays human (handshake deals, personal relationships, gut decisions)

### 4. Replaced Defensive Tone with Confidence
- Removed apologetic language about AI
- Added confident messaging about proven results
- Made CTAs more direct: "CLAIM YOUR 40% GROWTH" instead of "Let's see if our values align"

### 5. Added Practical Examples
- Tom's golf course deals with AI-powered conversation reminders
- Mary's handwritten notes with AI tracking
- Mike's gut decisions backed by data

### 6. Created Clear Methodology Section
- "The Boring Methodâ„¢" - 5-phase process
- Shows exactly HOW we're different
- Emphasizes gradual adoption and self-sufficiency

### 7. Updated Guarantees and Promises
- Focus on 40% revenue growth, not culture preservation
- Clear money-back guarantee
- Measurable business outcomes

## Result

The site now:
- Acknowledges that some old ways DO need updating
- Focuses on business growth, not just preservation
- Sounds confident rather than defensive
- Provides clear differentiation and methodology
- Appeals to practical business owners who want results

The messaging is now balanced: respectful of tradition while embracing smart modernization.
