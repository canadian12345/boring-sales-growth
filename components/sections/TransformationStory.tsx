            Manufacturing CEO's Wake-Up Call: 47% Revenue Growth
          </h3>
          
          <blockquote className="text-lg font-mono mb-6 italic">
            "I almost fired my entire sales team last year. 32 years in business, and I'd never been so frustrated. 
            Then we implemented BoringSales. Same guys who fought me on everything suddenly became my biggest AI advocates. 
            Why? Because it made THEM look like heroes. One rep closed three deals in one week that had been sitting for months. 
            Now he brags about 'his' AI assistant. Revenue's up 47%, but honestly? I'm just happy I don't dread Monday mornings anymore."
